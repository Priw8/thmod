Undefined Fantastic Four Seasons - beta version 1.0a by Priw8

A patch that adds UFOs to HSiFS. Why? Because it's possible, duh.
Though for now, it's only a beta version. Why it is technically complete, there are most likely things that can (and should) be improved.
Since I wouldn't be able to find all of these issue by myself, I decided to share this, uh, semi-tested version for others to test too.
If you find anything that's broken or could be improved, even the smallest things, message me on Discord: Priw8#9873

Notes:
- replays of this mod will desync unless started from the first stage (doesn't matter for practice replays and extra stage replays). This is because the game doesn't save the amount of life pieces/owned UFO tokens in the replay. While this is a bug I guess, fixing it would require a very large amount of reverse engineering the game and assembly coding (something I'm not going to do).
- UFO tokens give no PIV when collected. It might be implemented in the future version, but for now I wasn't able to do in in a way that looks good.
- collecting a UFO token when there already is a UFO summoned will drop seasonal items, recharging the release gauge.
- score extends are disabled. Otherwise it would be a complete resource fest.
- enemies that drop UFO tokens are indicated by small UFOs flying over their heads and an aura around them (the color of the aura changes depending on what kind of UFO token the enemy is going to drop)

Special thanks to Popfan (https://twitter.com/gensakudan) for making high quality versions of the UFO token bar sprites and of that thing that appears on the HUD after you summon a UFO, whatever it's called.
Most of other assets that weren't already in HSiFS were taken directly from UFO, so credit to ZUN for making them.
